======= TODO =======
- hotkeys (after audio playback)
	- ms .net documentation
	- global hotkeys for use when not in focus
		- look into keyhooks (if using global hotkeys)
	- search define hotkeys at runtime
	- https://github.com/Willy-Kimura/HotkeyListener
	- list as a contraint

- create video tutorial

Q - what are approaches to researching?
	- ms learn keyloggers
	- async
	- macros 

- allow "fire and forget" playback https://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2014/02/fire-and-forget-audio-playback-with.html
- research async handlers
- reorder list
- categories/tags
	 

=====COMPLETED======
- audio playback
	Look into naudio
- auto-resizing the window
- auto fill name from file name


=== Hotkey approach ===
Maybe it is a class that carries its own method for monitoring and dealing with events from keypresses
