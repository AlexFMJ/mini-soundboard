======= TODO =======
- hotkeys (after audio playback)
	- ms .net documentation
	- global hotkeys for use when not in focus
		- look into keyhooks (if using global hotkeys)
	- search define hotkeys at runtime
	- https://github.com/Willy-Kimura/HotkeyListener
	- list global hotkeys as a contraint
- categories/tags
- MIDI control

- create video tutorial


=====COMPLETED======
- audio playback
	Look into naudio
- auto-resizing the window
- auto fill name from file name
- reorder list functionality
	- https://www.inforbiro.com/blog/c-datagridview-drag-and-drop-rows-reorder

=== Hotkey approach ===
Maybe it is a class that carries its own method for monitoring and dealing with events from keypresses


====QUESTION=====
- what are approaches to researching?
	- ms learn keyloggers
	- async
	- macros
