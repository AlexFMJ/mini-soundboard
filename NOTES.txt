======= TODO =======
- LOOK INTO MAKING EMPTY KEYDATA ELEMENTS 'NONE' INSTEAD OF NULL
- make edit menu
- categories/tags
	-	allow editing tags from combobox? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.datagridviewcomboboxcolumn?view=windowsdesktop-8.0
- MIDI control
- Allow for looping
- automatic list sorting functionality
- save default list on close / load on open
- create video tutorial
- create themes for light and dark modes
- global hotkeys for use when not in focus

=====COMPLETED======
- audio playback
	Look into naudio
- auto-resizing the window
- auto fill name from file name
- manual reorder list functionality
	- https://www.inforbiro.com/blog/c-datagridview-drag-and-drop-rows-reorder
- save/load hotkey lists
- volume control functioning
- restart file on playback
- Error handling on file loading and saving
	? - check files on XML load
- text align the volume and hotkey
- hotkeys (after audio playback)
	- ms .net documentation
		- https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook
	- list global hotkeys as a contraint in documentation
- show volume as a percentage
- remove hotkeys when sfx dataview is removed

=== Hotkey approach ===
Maybe it is a class that carries its own method for monitoring and dealing with events from keypresses


====QUESTION=====
- what are approaches to researching?
	- ms learn keyloggers
	- async
	- macros 

====REFERENCE====
- custom datagridview cells
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/controls/customize-cells-and-columns-in-the-datagrid-by-extending-behavior?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8
