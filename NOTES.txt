======= TODO =======
- hotkeys (after audio playback)
	- ms .net documentation
	- global hotkeys for use when not in focus
		- https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook
	- list global hotkeys as a contraint in documentation
- categories/tags
- MIDI control
- automatic list sorting functionality
- show volume as a percentage
- save default list on close / load on open
- create video tutorial
- create themes for light and dark modes

=====COMPLETED======
- audio playback
	Look into naudio
- auto-resizing the window
- auto fill name from file name
- manual reorder list functionality
	- https://www.inforbiro.com/blog/c-datagridview-drag-and-drop-rows-reorder
- save/load hotkey lists
- volume control functioning
- restart file on playback
- Error handling on file loading and saving
	? - check files on XML load
- text align the volume and hotkey

=== Hotkey approach ===
Maybe it is a class that carries its own method for monitoring and dealing with events from keypresses


====QUESTION=====
- what are approaches to researching?
	- ms learn keyloggers
	- async
	- macros
